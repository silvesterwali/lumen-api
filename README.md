# Lumen PHP Framework


## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).


## What is this

The framework is created to make building your API application easier. Because there are some basics of what you need to develop the application such as authentication, permissions, rules and front-end page navigation.

This framework has also implemented JWT (json web token) to help authenticate and Spatie permissions packages in management the rules and permissions .

The authentication has login, logout, refresh, change password features . The Spatie Permission package is implemented to grant and revoke user permissions, as well as assign a rule to the user.

There is also a feature to set the pages that can be accessed by the front-end so that it makes it easier for users to navigate to complex pages and you can ignore this feature if your front-end pages are not so many.


## Open to contributors

If you want to help others, contribute your coding. There are no special rules, you just need to follow the rules in the Laravel framework
